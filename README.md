# Red Wine Quality Prediction using Data Mining

## Project Overview

The wine dataset contains various chemical details about the wine, such as acidity level, alcohol content, sweetness, and a rating of its quality. Our aim is to predict the quality of the wine based on these chemical properties. 
The intended audience for this project includes winemakers, wine experts, and wine sellers. They may use the analysis results to determine which chemical features are important in determining the quality of red wine. 
The predictions of this project can help identify the right price for the right quality of wine. In addition, the results can also help stakeholders devise appropriate marketing plans according to the quality of wines. 
Using prediction models, we can also develop rules to estimate the quality of wine and ultimately improve the wine-making process. Whether this analysis is a one-time event, or a continuous effort depends on the goals of the stakeholders. If the objective is to make better wine, ongoing analysis may be necessary.
